### **Task Instructions:**  

1. **Validation:**  
   First, determine if the document or Data is a **Board or Specialty Certificate** using the definition and attributes provided below:  
   
   **Definition:**  
   A **Board Certificate** is an official document or data of document issued by a recognized medical specialty board that verifies a healthcare provider (e.g., physician, surgeon, dentist) has completed advanced training in a specific medical specialty and has passed comprehensive examinations assessing their expertise and competence in that specialty.

   **Attributes for Validation:**  
   - Mention of a certifying board or organization (e.g., "American Board of Pediatrics," "NetCE").
   - Certification-related terms (e.g., "Board-Certified," "Certificate of Completion," "Diplomate").
   - Certification details such as certificate number, issue date, expiration date, specialty field, or status.

2. **Field Extraction:**  - board_name, speciality, certificate_number, issue_date, provider_name, expiration_date, status, reverification_date, enrolled_in_moc, validation_type, state, middle_name, first_name, last_name
   If the document is validated as a Board or Specialty Certificate, extract the following fields:

   - **Board Name:**  
     - Name of the certifying board or organization (e.g., "American Board of Pediatrics").
   
   - **Specialty:**  
     - The medical specialty for which the provider is certified (e.g., "Internal Medicine," "Pediatrics").

   - **Certificate Number:**  
     - A unique identifier assigned to the certificate by the certifying board.
     - Often labeled as "Certificate Number," or "ID Number."

   - **Issue Date:**  
     - The date when the certificate was officially issued by the certifying board.
     - Ensure this date is formatted as `yyyy-mm-dd`.
     - Look for terms like "Issued on" or "Date of Certification."

   - **Expiration Date:**  
     - The date when the certificate is set to expire or must be renewed.
     - Ensure this date is formatted as `yyyy-mm-dd`.
     - Look for terms like "Valid Until," "Expiration Date," or "Renewal Date."

   - **Status:**  
     - The current state of the certification (e.g., "Active," "Expired").

   - **Reverification Date:**  
     - The date on which the certification was last or next verified.
     - Ensure this date is formatted as `yyyy-mm-dd`.

   - **Enrolled in MOC:**  
     - Indicates if the provider is enrolled in **Maintenance of Certification (MOC)**, a program to keep certifications up-to-date.

   - **State:**  
     - The U.S. state where the certification or practice is valid or registered.

   - **Provider Name:**  
     Extract the following components of the provider’s full name:
     
     - **First Name:**  
       - The provider's first (given) name.

     - **Middle Name:**  
       - The provider’s middle name, which may consist of one or more words.  
       - Example: In "Zoe May Elizabeth Doherty," the middle name is "May Elizabeth."

     - **Last Name:**  
       - The provider's last (family) name.


3. **Handling OCR Data:**  
   - You will receive a field called `ocr_extracted_text`, which may either be an empty string or contain extracted text from the document.  
   - **Prioritize** the analysis of the provided document and image over OCR data. Use OCR data only as a secondary reference.  
And use following JSON format: {
    "document_info":[
    {
    "key":"value"
    }
    ],
    }
    else "document_info":[
        {
            'validation_type':"no"
        }

**Important Notes:**
1. If any key consist nothing or it is blank or null give "N/A" as a value.
